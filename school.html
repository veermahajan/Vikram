<h1 style="text-align:center;">Vikram's School</h1>
<p>Vikram has enjoyed school, he has learned a lot. Currently he is in virtual school. He is in the advanced path of his school programme & studied 6th and  7th grade math in Grade 6. He studied grade 8 and algebra in 7th, and is now studying geometry in 8th grade. While studying prealgebra in 6th grade on the side, he amassed a massive 122/120 on his first midterm. He also showed a flair for Science & his 5th grade teacher commented that science was his 'strong suit'. He routinely got 95s or 100s on most of his quizzes & tests. The following year in 6th grade he scored a 100 on each and everyone of his science tests & had a score of over 101 in Quarter Three. In one of his science homework assignments he wrote so well that his teacher accused him of plagiarism. He didn't, a claim which was later debunked, as the Big Lie .</p>
