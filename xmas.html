<h1>XMAS 2020!!!</h1>
		<img src="image-removebg-preview.png" alt = "Christmas Tree" style="width:36%; float:right; margin-right:1px;">
		<br><br><p>For X-mas Vikram got several books about politics and other stuff. One of these books, <strong>Hillbilly Elegy</strong> contained some meaningful insight in the life of the lower middle class of the Ohio River (but Vikram was horrified to learn that the author, JD Vance, running for Senate, betrayed his ideals and has gone from criticizing Trump to blindly supporting him and his false claims of election fraud in 2020!) and another book, the newest edititon of <strong>What You Should Know About Politics... But Don't</strong> allowed him to learn more about foreign policy, healthcare, the culture wars ,and election law, among many others!!!! He also got <strong>7 Tips for Highly Effective Teens</strong> by Mr. Sean Covey. Vikram also recieved some fun, action, movies!!</p>   </body>
