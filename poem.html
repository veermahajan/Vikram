<h2>Oil, Gas, and Coal - a Poem by Vikram</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="head">OIL, GAS AND COAL</span>
<em><br>
<br>
 Oil, gas and coal,<br>
Have taken their toll.
 <br><br>
 Oil and coal are the source of our energy,<br>
And have been so for multiple centuries.
<br><br> 
However, all three are examples of greenhouse gas,<br>
And are destroying our environment en masse.
 <br><br>
They release the greenhouse gases of carbon dioxide and methane,<br>
And what these greenhouses gases do is dangerous and inhumane,<br><br>
 
Inside our atmosphere, they trap heat,<br>
If you want to hear more, just take a seat!<br><br>

For when the heat is trapped,<br>
From the coal that we  extract,<br><br>
 
Icebergs in the ocean will melt,<br>
And their impact will be felt,<br><br>
 
For the temperatures will rise,<br>
And the oceans will rise,<br><br>
 
Leading to the demise<br>
Of coastal communities <br><br>
 
And no one will have immunity<br>
There will be global warming,<br>
And more storms will come a-storming,<br>
 <br><br>
Over 800 million people will face the impact,<br>
Of all the coal that we sought to extract,<br>
 <br><br>
By 2050, orangutans, gorillas, vaquitas,<br>
Polar bears, rhinos and cheetahs,<br><br>
 
Will all be extinct,<br>
Before we have time to so much as blink!
<br><br> 
This all can still be fixed, <br>
 But many politicians are intermixed,
 <br><br>
With the coal and oil industry,<br>
These industries rule the country.
 <br><br>
Some senators and representatives<br>
Are owned by oil executives.<br><br>

Bills to limit oil and coal come one after another,<br>
But these senators block and filibuster!
 <br><br>
The water in Flint, Michigan, is poisoned,<br>
A 'harmless' fuel that is deadlier than a gun!</em></p>
