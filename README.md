<h1>Vikram Q Mahajan</h1>
<h3>About Vikram:</h3>
<h6>Vikram is a 13 year old boy (he insists that he's almost 14). He was born in the United States. Some of his hobbies include reading, talking, watching TV, going onto little-known forums, and visiting Wikipedia pages. He is interested in politics, and dreams of becoming a senator, top forum poster, and vice president. <br>
During the COVID19 pandemic, Vikram was working hard to beat his previous mile time of 11:23. He, after much practice (roughly 3 times a week) managed to get a much better mile-time of roughly 11 minutes. He enjoys 'learning' Spanish, and is getting quite fluent in it. He also has posted a lot on the forum, even if it comes at an academic cost.</h6>

  <h6>Don't miss out, because he also claimed that Romney was persistent because he knew he was going to lose, but campaigned anyway. Investigations looking into whether that was a joke are ongoing.</h6></li>
